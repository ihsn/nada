<p>Example:</p>
<p>The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS3 Model Questionnaire with some modifications and additions. A household questionnaire was administered in each household, which collected information on household members including sex, age, relationship, and orphanhood status. The household questionnaire includes household characteristics, support to orphaned and vulnerable children, education, child labor, water and sanitation, household use of insecticide treated mosquito nets, and salt iodization, with optional modules for child discipline, child disability, maternal mortality and security of tenure and durability of housing.</p>
<p>In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. For children, the questionnaire was administered to the mother or caretaker of the child. </p>
<p>The women's questionnaire include women's characteristics, child mortality, tetanus toxoid, maternal and newborn health, marriage, polygyny, female genital cutting, contraception, and HIV/AIDS knowledge, with optional modules for unmet need, domestic violence, and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>The children's questionnaire includes children's characteristics, birth registration and early learning, vitamin A, breastfeeding, care of illness, malaria, immunization, and anthropometry, with an optional module for child development.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were developed in English from the MICS3 Model Questionnaires, and were translated into Mumbo-jumbo. After an initial review the questionnaires were translated back into English by an independent translator with no prior knowledge of the survey. The back translation from the Mumbo-jumbo version was independently reviewed and compared to the English original. Differences in translation were reviewed and resolved in collaboration with the original translators.</p>

<p>Example :</p>
<p>Data were processed in clusters, with each cluster being processed as a complete unit through each stage of data processing.  Each cluster goes through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> Questionnaire reception</li>
<li> Office editing and coding</li>
<li> Data entry</li>
<li> Structure and completeness checking</li>
<li> Verification entry</li>
<li> Comparison of verification data</li>
<li> Back up of raw data</li>
<li> Secondary editing</li>
<li> Edited data backup</li>
<p>After all clusters are processed, all data is concatenated together and then the following steps are completed for all data files:</p>
<li> Export to SPSS in 4 files (hh - household, hl - household members, wm - women, ch - children under 5)</li>
<li> Recoding of variables needed for analysis</li>
<li> Adding of sample weights</li>
<li> Calculation of wealth quintiles and merging into data</li>
<li> Structural checking of SPSS files</li>
<li> Data quality tabulations</li>
<li> Production of analysis tabulations</li>
</ol>
<p>Details of each of these steps can be found in the data processing documentation, data editing guidelines, data processing programs in CSPro and SPSS, and tabulation guidelines.</p>
<p>Data entry was conducted by 12 data entry operators in tow shifts, supervised by 2 data entry supervisors, using a total of 7 computers (6 data entry computers plus one supervisors' computer).  All data entry was conducted at the GenCenStat head office using manual data entry.  For data entry, CSPro version 2.6.007 was used with a highly structured data entry program, using system controlled approach that controlled entry of each variable.  All range checks and skips were controlled by the program and operators could not override these.  A limited set of consistency checks were also included in the data entry program.  In addition, the calculation of anthropometric Z-scores was also included in the data entry programs for use during analysis. Open-ended responses (\"Other\" answers) were not entered or coded, except in rare circumstances where the response matched an existing code in the questionnaire. </p>  
<p>Structure and completeness checking ensured that all questionnaires for the cluster had been entered, were structurally sound, and that women's and children's questionnaires existed for each eligible woman and child. </p>
<p>100% verification of all variables was performed using independent verification, i.e. double entry of data, with separate comparison of data followed by modification of one or both datasets to correct keying errors by original operators who first keyed the files. </p>
<p>After completion of all processing in CSPro, all individual cluster files were backed up before concatenating data together using the CSPro file concatenate utility.</p>
<p>For tabulation and analysis SPSS versions 10.0 and 14.0 were used.  Version 10.0 was originally used for all tabulation programs, except for child mortality.  Later version After transferring all files to SPSS, certain variables were recoded for use as background characteristics in the tabulation of the data, including grouping age, education, geographic areas as needed for analysis.  In the process of recoding ages and dates some random imputation of dates (within calculated constraints) was performed to handle missing or \"don't know\" ages or dates.  Additionally, a wealth (asset) index of household members was calculated using principal components analysis, based on household assets, and both the score and quintiles were included in the datasets for use in tabulations.</p>

$lang['EstSmpErr']="<p>For sampling surveys, it is good practice to calculate and publish sampling error. This field is used to provide information on these calculations. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of ratios/indicators for which sampling errors were computed. </li>
<li> Details regarding the software used for computing the sampling error, and reference to the programs used (to be provided as external resources) as the program used to perform the calculations.</li>
<li>Reference to the reports or other document where the results can be found (to be provided as external resources). </li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Estimates from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: 1) non-sampling errors and 2) sampling errors. Non-sampling errors are the results of mistakes made in the implementation of data collection and data processing.  Numerous efforts were made during implementation of the 2005-2006 MICS to minimize this type of error, however, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically.</p>
<p>If the sample of respondents had been a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulae for calculating sampling errors.  However, the 2005-2006 MICS sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and consequently needs to use more complex formulae. The SPSS complex samples module has been used to calculate sampling errors for the 2005-2006 MICS.  This module uses the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. This method is documented in the SPSS file CSDescriptives.pdf found under the Help, Algorithms options in SPSS. </p>
</p>Sampling errors have been calculated for a select set of statistics (all of which are proportions due to the limitations of the Taylor linearization method) for the national sample, urban and rural areas, and for each of the five regions.  For each statistic, the estimate, its standard error, the coefficient of variation (or relative error -- the ratio between the standard error and the estimate), the design effect, and the square root design effect (DEFT -- the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used), as well as the 95 percent confidence intervals (+/-2 standard errors).</p>
<p>Details of the sampling errors are presented in the sampling errors appendix to the report and in the sampling errors table presented in the external resources.</p>
